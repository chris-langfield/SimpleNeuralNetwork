# SimpleNeuralNetwork

Based on the tutorial by James Loy found here: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-own-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-68998a08e4f6. Changes are mostly for clarity, and increased customizability (e.g. number of inputs/outputs/hidden layer neurons)

** biases and backprop algorithm still TODO **
